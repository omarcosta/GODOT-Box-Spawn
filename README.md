# ðŸ“¦Box Spawn (prototype)

The project uses Godot Engine and the GDScript language to create a game prototype. The idea is to create objects (boxes) where the player clicks with the right mouse button.

To make it more interesting, three types of boxes were created, and a random function defines which will be the next object created. Each box has unique physics settings and inherits basic characteristics from the main object.

The "GameManager" node is the only one that has a script; all the prototype management is done through it.
